<h2>"Best breakfast ever"</h2>

    in the whole world, I have been eating it for years 
    and I never get tired of it. They are delicious 
    eggs with fried bacon; I will give you my most 
    secret secrets of how to prepare them.</p>

            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Bacon</li>

            <li>Smile like a great artist about to perform</li>
            <li>Put your ingrediants aside</li>
            <li>Use a regular pan and put it on the stove, 
                fry bacon in a pan on medium-low flame until they are crispy. 
                Transfer them into a plate.</li>
            <li>Use the same pan to cook eggs. Crack eggs in the pan and cook 
                them as you like; sunny side up. Cover the pan so that the egg 
                cooks properly. </li>
            <li>Add salt to the eggs</li>
            <li>Serve your favorite juice in your favorite glass</li>
            <li>Now the final touch, put two bread slices in the microwave for 30 seconds 
                and put them on the plate too.</li>
            </ol>
